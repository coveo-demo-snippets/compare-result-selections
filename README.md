# compare-result-selections

This code works on a Visualforce page. The use case is to compare selections on a hotel, like you would do with Expedia search for example.

1. It uses a TemplateLoader on the result layout for the hotel room to add a inputCheckbox on each result. In the Interface Editor, under CodeView, you can add this code.


2. On your Visualforce Page, you can include the code in *** file.
